<h2>Top  movies of all time </h2>
<hr />
<h3> The lovebirds </h3>
<p>This show was really on my list mainly beacause <br />its  a tragicomedy and i'm not usually entertained by that gener of movies but this keep me on my toes  </p>
<h3>The Nun</h3>
<P>The movie is quick paced and doesn't really get you bored with good performances by the cast</P>
<h3>Avengers: Age of Ultron</h3>
<P> This movie has amazing action scenes, great dialogue, and much more. The only thing I would ever take away is the comedy. It’s more of sprinkled over the whole movie (mainly through Ultron) and I personally feel like it made people say it’s bad due to trailers making it seem like it was serious, but when they see the movie it’s not</P>
